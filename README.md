# eCommerceProject
***
## Description:
Our application is a bookstore where users can search for and buy books to their checkout.
***
## Technologies Used: 
On the frontend, this project primarily uses the React JavaScript library. This means the primary languages used are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This frontend React project makes API calls to the backend setup through Axios, a promise-based HTTP client that also uses JavaScript. The backend is an API built with Express, which also uses JavaScript to build API calls. The backend API calls are used to make calls both to Google Book's API (for book information) and the Firebase API (for updating the databases).
